## What I learned

This wasn't a very difficult project for me, but I just wanted to do something simple to remind myself how to implement React as it's been a while. I increased the difficulty by including more complicated transitions (such as the card flipping when the form is submitted).

## Continued development

Not sure what I will do next but I'm trying to learn something new with each project.
